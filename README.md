Bot intended to ban our friends from the Discord server if they play too much League of Legends or any other game we decide to add. Planning on incorporating a tracker that can display how long users have been doing certain gaming activities, seeing as some people on our friend group play... a bit too much I guess you could say.

Currently exploring options to implement a DJ functionality (that is easy to use) so that we can swap it in for "Hydra", the current DJ/Music bot we are using.
